Line 14: Nice job! Let me know if you'd like to discuss how to effectively use helper functions in future assignments.
Line 25: This logic is correct, but it requires you to create a new arrays of sizes `n-1, n-2, ..., 1` (where n is the length of the original array). You can get around this by creating a helper function and passing the index of the 'new' array to it.
Line 48: The same concept applies here as in my comment above. Instead of creating a new array, you can create a helper function that takes as argument a `lower` and `upper` bound.
Line 60: This works (and satisfies the compiler). But it's weird to have a never reached statement in your code. Instead, use, `if...else` logic (instead of serial ifs) to encode mutually exclusive paths.
