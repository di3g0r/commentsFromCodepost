Line 31: Careful! The `++` operator, when placed _after_ the variable name, increments the value of the variable after it is evaluated. This means that if `someVar = 1`, `someFunction(someVar++)` is equivalent to `someFunction(1)`.

Because of this behavior, your code infinitely loops, continually calling `sumHelper(arr, 0)` and never reaching your base case.
